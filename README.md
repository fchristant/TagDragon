####Introduction
Tagdragon is a simple, robust and configurable autosuggest plugin that allows you to easily implement *auto suggest* or *type-ahead* functionality on your web page.

The basic working of the plugin is to place it on a web page and link it to a back-end JSON service that provides the suggestions. There are several options to configure the exact behavior. In addition, the control can run in default mode, where a dropdown-like control is rendered, or in override mode, where you can completely overrule the rendering of the output of the returned suggestions.
