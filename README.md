TagDragon - jQuery Autosuggest plugin
=========

**Note**: TagDragon used to be a commercial jQuery plugin. It is hereby free, donated to the community to use, fork and improve. Support by the original author is limited. Use as you wish.

####Introduction
Tagdragon is a simple, robust and configurable autosuggest plugin that allows you to easily implement *auto suggest* or *type-ahead* functionality on your web page.

The basic working of the plugin is to assign it to an input or textarea element on your web page and to link it to a back-end JSON service that provides the suggestions. There are several options to configure the exact behavior. In addition, the control can run in default mode, where a dropdown-like control is rendered, or in override mode, where you can completely overrule the rendering of the output of the returned suggestions.
